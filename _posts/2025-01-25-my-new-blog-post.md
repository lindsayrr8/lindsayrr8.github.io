# Getting Started with Data Visualization: Using Tableau and Google Dataset Search

As a first task to get our feet wet with **data visualization,** we're instructed to find a **free dataset** that is publicly available using [Google Dataset Search.](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

With our dataset, we will be using a very prominent data visualization software: **Tableau.** Tableau is used by professional data analysts and newbies alike. You might often hear Tableau described as "the next generation of Excel." That is, Tableau can be used to quickly and easily analyze data while also offering more advanced data customization features. [**Tableau Public** is free to download,](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) so that is the iteration of the software we will be working with today.

For this task, we will be creating a **geographic map** using the data we find. Therefore, it is very important that we choose a dataset that has a built-in "Addresses" column or geographic coordinate information. This helps Tableau automatically associate our data with a map. Later on when we complete more advanced tasks with Tableau, it will be possible to add a spatial dimension to other datasets which lack one. But for now, we're going to stick to a simple exercise to demonstrate Tableau's capabilities.

## To begin, I've selected a dataset of Florida's Recreation Facilities and Parks.
[This data](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/FDACS::florida-recreation-and-parks/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C0.70) was last provided as of July, 2020, courtesy of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The dataset already maps nicely onto the provided visualization, but we're going to recreate it while making a few minor changes to it.

*(Note: This exercise was completed on Windows, so the guide is written for Windows users.)*

## Here's a few quick steps to follow to get us started:
1. Download Tableau Public [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover)
2. Open Tableau Public. *(On Windows, either launch from the Desktop shortcut or search "Tableau" using âŠž Windows search.)*
3.
