# Getting Started with Data Visualization: Using Tableau and Google Dataset Search

As a first task to get our feet wet with **data visualization,** we're instructed to find a **free dataset** that is publicly available using [Google Dataset Search.](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

For this task, we will be creating a **geographic map** using the data we find. Therefore, it is very important that we choose a dataset that has a built-in "Addresses" column or geographic coordinate information. This helps Tableau automatically associate our data with a map.
