# A Welcome to Visual Analytics

Today, this blog will transition from solely focusing on statistical analysis with R to further explorations in visual analytics.

**Visual Analytics** is an important part of data science that comes into play after we have done our initial number crunching. It employs creativity and technical skills to put data insights to good use. After all, what is the point of analyzing data if not to find out and communicate something valuable?

Following certain design principles, *good* visual analytics can represent data insights in a quick, concise, and easily understood way. Some of the most common visual representations of data come in the form of images like line graphs, bar charts, or pie charts. These can be helpful in communicating often complex information in a simple, non-technical way.

*According to Keim et al. (2008), the aim of visual analytics should be to:*
> Synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic, ambiguous, and often conflicting data. <br />
> – Detect the expected and discover the unexpected. <br />
> – Provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments. <br />
> – Communicate assessment effectively for action. <br />

### The first given task is to evaluate a data visualization that caught my eye recently.
With the arrival of the recent new year, people tend to like to reflecting back on what happened in the previous one. While finding myself ~doomscrolling~ browsing reflections from 2024, I came across a visualization depicting **which U.S. states saw the most move-in's versus move-out's last year.** Being a ~broke Zillennial seeking to rent a repurposed shipping container under $2,000 per month~ young, aspiring data scientist living in a large city, this finding from the Tax Foundation was particularly interesting to me:
