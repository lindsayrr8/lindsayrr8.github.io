## Linear Regression with R

Linear Regression is an important concept in predictive analytics. But what do we use it for? ***Simple Linear Regression*** is a way to describe a relationship between two variables. Typically, we think of these two variables as a **dependent variable** and an **independent variable.**

The word "regression" in this context literally refers to a measurement of a relationship between two variables. However, it might also make some sense to apply the alternate definition of regression here, which means to return to a previous or more basic state.

I like to associate it with the idea of untying a knot. When a shoelace, for example, is tied into a neat bow, someone just stumbling upon it for the first time might have difficulty figuring out where the knot begins and ends. Thankfully, with shoes as in mathematics, we've developed a process to untie the knot, making it simpler and easier to figure out where it started. That way, we can derive a reasonable explanation for how 'A' probably led to 'B.'
