# Creating a Visualization with Plotly

For this exercise, we are prompted to create a visualization using Plotly. To do so, we are given a basic time series dataset with two columns: "Average Position" and "Time."

**Plotly** (or Plot.ly) is a free, open-source graphing library that can be accessed with an internet browser. Under the hood, Plotly is a JavaScript library useful for creating interactive visualizations on the web. You might choose to use Plotly when you need to create dashboards, data exploration tools, or other interactive objects intended to be visually appealing for web pages. Plotly also comes as a Python or R library, both of which are built on top of Plotly.js.
