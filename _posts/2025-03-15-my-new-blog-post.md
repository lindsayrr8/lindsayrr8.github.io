# Principles of Design and Multivariate Analysis Visualization with Tableau

Relationships between different variables in your data can often be complex. It follows that sometimes figuring out how to visualize those relationships quickly and concisely can be a challenge. Circumstances can differ drastically, so there isn't one best solution, but one rule to follow is that the simplest approach is often the best *(and you will hear me say that often.)*

That said, when creating any visualization, there are a few basic **principles of design** you can keep in mind to incorporate into your work:

1. **Alignment** - Creates an "invisible connection" or continuity between elements that are not close to each other.
2. **Repetition** - colors, shapes, fonts, textures, and other stylistic choices can appear frequently to create association and consistency.
3. **Contrast** - using opposite elements (like big or small shapes, thick or thin lines, bright or dark colors, etc.) to highlight or emphasize something.
4. **Proximity** - grouping similar elements together helps to create a sense of a relationship or focal point.
5. **Balance** - balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical, but it doesn't have to mean "same."
