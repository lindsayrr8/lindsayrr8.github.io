# Adding Basic Graphics to a Visualization with Adobe Illustrator

Using the map created in Tableau in the previous exercise, we'll demonstrate adding useful graphics onto visualizations. This skill comes in handy when necessity calls for creative enhancements.

In this case, I'll be using **Adobe Illustrator** to add a few simple details to the map of Florida's Parks and Recreation facilities. Illustrator is a premium application that allows digital professionals to create **vector graphics.** (I'm very grateful that it, along with Adobe Creative Cloud, have been provided to me for free through my university.)

## What is a vector?
Well, to make a bit of a simple generalization, vectors can be thought of as extremely high quality images.

The typical, everyday images we often see on screens are made up of **pixels.** (These images are also called "rasters.") Pixels are millions of awesome, tiny squares that come together to create a complete image. They work great for most applications in daily life, but start to encounter some problems when images either need to be very large or become resized. If you've ever zoomed in on a picture and started to see blurry or "pixelated" edges, then you know it's not a great look.

This is where **vectors** come to the rescue. A vector is another kind of image which is made up of mathematical equations that create lines, shapes, and colors rather than predetermined pixels. As a result, vector images can be scaled up and down infinitely without quality loss or "pixelization." It's easy to see why this is the preferred graphic format for companies and other professional institutions. Imagine seeing [this](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.684364772.2408/pp,504x498-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.u1.jpg) on a billboard in Times Square! (That kind of advertising might work for [Wendy's,](https://media.firstcoastnews.com/assets/WTLV/images/a6fce8d6-5cb3-4cc1-ba7d-21878b73ee8e/a6fce8d6-5cb3-4cc1-ba7d-21878b73ee8e_1140x641.jpg) but not for Berkshire Hathaway.)

## Adding vectors with Illustrator
So to start putting some basic vector shapes on the Florida map, I've already downloaded and activated Illustrator.
Briefly, here are the steps I took to get started:
> 1. I opened the map image in Illustrator. I named this first layer "map base."
> 2. I created a second new layer, "cities," where I placed the names of several major cities in Florida on the map.
> 3. I created a third new layer, "stars," where I added yellow star shapes to visualize the cities' locations.
> 4. I added a fourth new layer, "text," where I wrote "Florida Parks & Recreation."
> 5. Finally, I added another layer beneath "text" where I highlighted the text with blue rectangles.

After finishing my additions to the map, I saved the image with: Export â†’ Save for the Web.

And here is the result:

## What do the graphics add?
The addition of the five major cities adds a little more context to the image. Now someone looking at the map can quickly gauge where most parks are clustered in relation to the cities. For example, it looks like the most densely clustered parks and recreation facilities are around Tampa and Orlando in central Florida. There are also quite a few more along the coasts, in particular on the eastern coast of the state, intersecting Miami and Jacksonville. 

## What could be improved?
As always, this largely depends on what question we are asking and attempting to answer with this map. The addition of the new details does help to make the map more specific, but there are numerous improvements we could make depending on what we're trying to convey.

In this case, someone looking at the map to decide which Florida parks to visit could quickly make the judgment to stick to central or eastern Florida due to the prevalence of recreational facilities in those areas. But while that is an important step in narrowing down one's travel plans, it still doesn't get very far down to the specifics. A few ideas to make this map even more specific might be to add other visual features such as: major or highly rated parks icons, major highways connecting these areas, visually distinct icons separating areas like "campgrounds" or "beaches," and a legend/map key explaining it all. This would still be generalized, but specific enough to then start asking more questions and making travel plans.
