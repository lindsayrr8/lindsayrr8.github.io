# Adding Basic Graphics to a Visualization with Adobe Illustrator

Using the map created in Tableau in the previous exercise, we'll demonstrate adding useful graphics onto visualizations. This skill comes in handy when necessity calls for creative enhancements.

In this case, I'll be using **Adobe Illustrator** to add a few simple details to the map of Florida's Parks and Recreation facilities. Illustrator is a premium application that allows digital professionals to create **vector graphics.** (I'm very grateful that it, along with Adobe Creative Cloud, have been provided to me for free through my university.)

## What is a vector?
Well, to make a bit of a simple generalization, vectors can be thought of as extremely high quality images.

The typical, everyday images we often see on screens are made up of **pixels.** (These images are also called "rasters.") Pixels are millions of awesome, tiny squares that come together to create a complete image. They work great for most applications in daily life, but start to encounter some problems when images either need to be very large or become resized. If you've ever zoomed in on a picture and started to see blurry or "pixelated" edges, then you know it's not a great look.

This is where **vectors** come to the rescue. A vector is another kind of image which is made up of mathematical equations that create lines, shapes, and colors rather than predetermined pixels. As a result, they can be scaled up and down infinitely without quality loss or "pixelization."
