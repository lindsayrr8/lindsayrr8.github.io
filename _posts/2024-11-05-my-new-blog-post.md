# Multivariate Analysis with R

Briefly, multivariate analysis is a statistical approach to **analyzing the relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.** This is especially useful when working with big datasets involving complex relationships.

To experiment with multivariate analysis with R, we're tasked with answering the following questions:
> **Question 1.** <br />
> Conduct ANOVA (analysis of variance) and regression coefficients on the data from data ("cystfibr") database. You can choose any variable you like to interpret. In the report, you need to state the result of coefficients and significance to any variables you like both under ANOVA and multivariate analysis. Please provide a specific interpretation of R results. <br />
> *and* <br />
> **Question 2.** <br />
> The secher data("secher") are best analyzed after log-transforming birth weight as well as the abdominal and biparietal diameters. Fit a prediction weight as well as abdominal and biparietal diameters. For a prediction equation for birth weight. How much is gained by using both diameters in a prediction equation? The sum of the two regression coefficients is almost identical and equal to 3. Can this be given a nice interpretation to our analysis?
Please provide step by step on your analysis and code you use to find out the result.
