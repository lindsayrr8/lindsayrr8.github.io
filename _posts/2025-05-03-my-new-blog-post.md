# Amazon E-Book Sales Performance Analysis

In 1994, the world's largest online retailer began as a small online bookstore in a Washington garage. I am of course talking about **Amazon,** which is so often cited in modern discussions surrounding business and e-commerce.

Though Amazon is not primarily known for its book sales anymore, it still maintains significant influence over the book retail market, both in terms of paper books and digital ones. I recently came across this visualization from [passivesecrets.com](https://passivesecrets.com/amazon-book-sales-statistics/) which shows just how much:

There are already numerous discussions about how Amazon's position in the book retail market affects traditional retail methods like brick-and-mortar bookstores. One strength of Amazon's business model that has enticed 71% of consumers to choose purchasing books online is likely the **convenience** factor. It's quick and easy for someone to add a book to their cart from the same place and within the same transaction that they're purchasing other items. *(I myself have purchased paper books from Amazon before.)*

### E-Book Economics?

One thing I *don't* do is purchase **e-books** from Amazon. Several years ago with the rise of **e-readers,** I acquired a used Kindle Paperwhite to try to make more time for reading as a busy, over-encumbered college student. This changed the game for me as I started renting **free e-books** from my local library via my Kindle. 

Amazon's finance department was a few steps ahead of me, however. In 2014, **Kindle Unlimited** was launched, which offered consumers access to thousands of "free" e-books for a small fee of about $12 per month. But why would consumers pay $12 monthly for access to e-books they can get for free at the library?

Amazon had the answer to that. Any e-books offered on Kindle Unlimited were **not allowed to be offered on any other platform** or by any other service. So if you want that
