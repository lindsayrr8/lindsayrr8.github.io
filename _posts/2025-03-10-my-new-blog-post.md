# Visualizing Correlation Analysis with ggplot2

I've talked about correlation analysis on this blog before. Today we are going to **visualize** it.

Creating a visualization to **explore correlation** between different variables is a quick and easy approach to spotting trends and patterns in data. There are several ways we can go about doing this and I will be showcasing two of these.

## To begin, I'll create a basic scatter plot and add a line of best fit:
You know the deal with these, right? A scatter plot of data points will show us any clusters or directional trends, and a line of best fit will summarize that pattern.
