# Visualizing a Social Network Using NodeXL

This week, I experimented with creating a social network visualization utilizing the **NodeXL plugin.** Given that I've spent a lot of time with `R` lately, I decided to stop in for a visit with Excel and try out something different.

To create the visualization, I made my own Addams Family dataset from scratch. The dataset itself consists of three columns: Person1, Person2, and Relationship, including 21 rows or "observations" of these relationships.

## Using NodeXL Basic
After downloading the NodeXL Basic plugin, I searched up the included **template** file and added in my dataset. There are two primary tabs of interest in the template: Edges and Vertices. The values input here use formulas to map data onto the visualization.
