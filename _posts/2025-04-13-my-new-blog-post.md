# Visualizing a Social Network Using NodeXL

This week, I experimented with creating a social network visualization utilizing the NodeXL plugin. Given that I've spent a lot of time with `R` lately, I decided to stop in for a visit with Excel and try out a new plugin.

To create the visualization, I made my own Addams Family dataset from scratch. The dataset itself consists of three columns: Person1, Person2, and Relationship, including 21 rows or "observations" of these relationships.
