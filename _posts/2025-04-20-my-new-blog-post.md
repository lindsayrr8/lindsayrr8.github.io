# Creating a Basic Animation with R

This week, I enjoyed getting to do something that is both new and familiar to me: creating an animation with `R`'s `animation` library by Yihui Xie.

One thing I enjoy the most about data analytics and visualization is that it is a very multi-disciplinary field. It's a mix of math, art, and science (and maybe a little madness too.) Therefore, to excel in this field it follows that you'd want to have an aptitude (or at least a tolerance) for all of the above.
