# Creating a Basic Animation with R

This week, I enjoyed getting to do something that is both new and familiar to me: **creating an animation** with `R`'s `animation` library by Yihui Xie.

One thing I enjoy the most about data analytics and visualization is that it is a very **multi-disciplinary** field. It's a mix of **math, art, and science** *(and maybe a little madness too.)* Therefore, to excel in this field it follows that you'd want to have an aptitude (or at least a tolerance) for all of the above.

Long before I started my journey as an aspiring data analyst, I once attended an art school. Longer before that, I spent the first half of my life creating traditional art. Now I'm both a hobbyist digital artist and a data visualization professional in the works! (Life sure is a whirlwind that way.)

An interest in science was also something that came naturally to me, but an aptitude for mathematics was not. It took me some time and effort to come to the place I'm at today where I grin at the word "statistics" while my brilliant engineering peers cower (muahahaha!)

This blog is not my diary ~~(that's Gemini!)~~ so I won't bore you with the details. But I'd just like to state that the most significant factor in the transformation that led me to the path I'm on today is: **curiosity.**

The thing I love most about data science is the process of figuring things out. I like being able to look at a system where something is happening, riddle it out, and then take action that produces real results based on what I've found.

As such, it gives me immense satisfaction to combine these skills and interests to create...
