# Comparing Visualizations Between Base R and ggplot2

This week, we're going to briefly cover some visual differences between plots using base R and ggplot2. Since I've already covered ggplot2 and some differences between it and base R on this blog, we're going to keep this brief and focus on the image rather than the code.

To do this, I've selected a dataset from Kaggle on [US College Data.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashgpt/us-college-data) We'll be using data on my university, The University of South Florida, to demonstrate several different types of graphs.
