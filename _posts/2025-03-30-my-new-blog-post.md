# Comparing Visualizations Between Base R and ggplot2

This week, we're going to briefly cover some visual differences between plots using base R and ggplot2. Since I've already covered ggplot2 and some differences between it and base R on this blog, we're going to keep this brief and focus on the image rather than the code.

To do this, we'll be using the `economics` dataset that comes packaged in with RStudio, which showcases unemployment rates over time.
