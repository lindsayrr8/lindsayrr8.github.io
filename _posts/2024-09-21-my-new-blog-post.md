# An Intro to Probability Theory with R

This week, we have a few different tasks ahead of us as we master the basics of **Probability Theory.**

As a quick recap:
- Probability predicts the likelihood of an event to occur.
- In Statistics, probability is represented by a value between 0 and 1.


### To begin evaluating probability, weâ€™re given the following table:

|    |    |    |
|----|----|----|  
|    | B  | B1 |
| A  | 10 | 20 |
| A1 | 20 | 40 |

From this table, we're given the prompt:
### What is the probability of:
1. Event A
2. Event B
3. Event A or B
4. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

To begin thinking about this problem, we should calculate the **total** number of observations in this case.
<br>Total:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 + 20 + 20 + 40 = 90<br />

1. Event A refers to the first row of the table. If we read this row across, we find that the total for row A is 10 + 20 = 30. Therefore, **the probability of Event A is:**
<br>$P(A \mid B)$ $=$ 	$\frac{30}{90}$ $=$ 	$\frac{1}{3}$<br />
We can write this result as a decimal or a percent. The value is the same: ~0.333 or ~33%.

2. Event B refers to the column labeled "B." The total for this colum is: 10 + 20 = 30. Therefore, the probability of Event B is:
<br>$P(A \mid B)$ $=$ 	$\frac{30}{90}$ $=$ 	$\frac{1}{3}$<br />
Again, this can be written in either form as shown above in number 1.

It looks like the probabilities of Event A and Event B are independently equal!

3. But what about either Event A *or* Event B? To calculate $P(A \mid B)$, we need to find the sum of the probability of A *and* B, but subtract the quantity where they overlap to avoid factoring it into our calculations twice.

<br> Remember, we want to find the probability of A OR B, not A AND B, because we're not calculating if they will happen at the same time in this case. We're interested in the probability of either occuring separately.<br />

<br> Therefore, we can use the formula:<br />
<br>$P(A or B)$ $=$ $P(A)+P(B)-P(A and B)$<br />
