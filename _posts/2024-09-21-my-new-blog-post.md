# An Intro to Probability Theory with R

This week, we have a few different tasks ahead of us as we master the basics of Probability Theory.

As a quick recap:
- Probability predicts the likelihood of an event to occur.
- In Statistics, probability is represented by a value between 0 and 1.

To begin evaluating probability, weâ€™re given the following table:
