# An Intro to Probability Theory with R

This week, we have a few different tasks ahead of us as we master the basics of **Probability Theory.**

As a quick recap:
- Probability predicts the likelihood of an event to occur.
- In Statistics, probability is represented by a value between 0 and 1.

To begin evaluating probability, weâ€™re given the following table:

|    |    |    |
|----|----|----|  
|    | B  | B1 |
| A  | 10 | 20 |
| A1 | 20 | 40 |

From this table, we're given the prompt:
### Based on Table 1 What is the probability of:
1. Event A
2. Event B?
3. Event A or B
4. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
