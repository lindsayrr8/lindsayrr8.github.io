# Title

This week, we're given the following prompt utilizing the `ashina` data frame in `R`:
> Question 1. 10.1 <br />
Set up an additive model for the ashina data, as part of ISwR package <br />
> This data contain additive effects on subjects, period and treatment. Compare the results with those obtained from t tests.

Putting it simply, an **additive model** is a statistical model where the effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable get added all together. This way you can look at how each variable individually impacts your results.

In statistics-speak, an additive model is a **nonparametric regression method.** This is something we use when we think there is some kind of relationship between variables, but we're not assuming what kind. In fact, we can use this in cases where the relationship is both **unknown** and **nonlinear.**
