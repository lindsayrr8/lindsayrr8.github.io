# Tufte Principles of Data Presentation with ggplot2 and lattice

This week, I explored two different approaches to creating a dot-dash plot in `R` using the `ggplot2` and `lattice` packages.

Naturally in this case, these charts both visualize the same data in slightly different ways. The given sample of data we'll be looking into has to do with per capita budget expenditures from 1967 to 1977.

We'll be evaluating how well each of these visualizations implement Edward Tufte's principles of clean and minimalist data presentation.
